## Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Landing Page]**

"Hello! Today I'm presenting FluentFusion, an AI-driven language learning platform designed specifically for Rwanda's tourism sector.

FluentFusion bridges communication gaps by helping tourists learn Kinyarwanda and tourism workers improve their English skills through interactive, tourism-focused lessons.

Let's dive in and see how it works."

## Section 1: User Registration & Authentication (1 minute)

**[Screen: Landing Page]**

"First, let's create an account. I'll register as a tourist who wants to learn Kinyarwanda."

**[Click "Get Started" button]**

**[Screen: Registration Page]**

"The registration process is straightforward. I'll enter:
- Username: demo_tourist
- Email: tourist@demo.com
- User type: Tourist
- Target language: Kinyarwanda
- Password

Notice how the application asks for user type and target language - this personalizes the entire learning experience."

## Section 2: Dashboard & AI Recommendations (1.5 minutes)

**[Screen: Dashboard]**

"The dashboard provides a complete overview of your learning journey. Notice several key features:

**Statistics Cards:** 
- Completed lessons: 0 (we're just starting)
- Average score
- Time invested
- Overall progress

**Progress Bar:**
Shows visual progress through all available lessons.

**AI-Powered Recommendations:**
This is the heart of our ML system. Even as a new user, the AI recommends appropriate beginner lessons:
- 'Essential Greetings & Courtesies' - 90% confidence match
- 'Hotel & Accommodation Essentials'
- 'Restaurant & Food Ordering'

Each recommendation shows:
- Difficulty level
- Duration
- Why it's recommended
- Confidence score

The algorithm considers:
- User type (tourist vs tourism worker)
- Current skill level
- Learning patterns
- Difficulty progression

Let me show you how this works by completing a lesson."

Each phrase shows the context where you'd use it - like casual greeting or responding to someone."

**[Click "Continue to Cultural Notes"]**

**[Screen: Cultural Notes]**

"**Stage 3: Cultural Notes**
This is unique to FluentFusion - we don't just teach language, we teach cultural context:
- 'Greetings are very important in Rwandan culture'

- 'Handshakes with left hand on right elbow shows respect'

This helps tourists understand the WHY behind the language."

**[Click "Start Exercises"]**

**[Screen: Exercises]**

Now let's test what we learned. The lesson has 4 different exercise types:

**Exercise 1: Multiple Choice**

I'll select Mwaramutse..."

**[Select answer, click "Check Answer"]**

**[Screen shows green checkmark]**

"Correct! The system provides immediate feedback and explains why this is correct: 'Mwaramutse is used specifically for morning greetings.'

**Exercise 2: Fill in the Blank**
'Complete: Amakuru _____? (How are you?)'

I'll type 'yawe'..."

**[Type answer, check]**

"Perfect! 10 points earned. The explanation helps reinforce learning: 'Yawe means "your", making the complete phrase "your news?"'

**Exercise 3: Matching**
Match the greeting with its meaning.

**Exercise 4: More practice questions**

Each correct answer earns points. The system tracks everything."
